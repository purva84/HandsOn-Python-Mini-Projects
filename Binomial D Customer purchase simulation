## âœ… Real-Life Program Using Binomial Distribution

ðŸŽ¯ Program Idea: "Customer Purchase Simulation"

You run an online store. Out of 100 people who visit your website, each person has a 30% chance of buying something.

Letâ€™s simulate this using the binomial distribution to estimate how many people will actually buy.

## ðŸ’» Python Code (Using binomial distribution logic)

import random

visitors = 100
prob = 0.3  # 30% chance of purchase
buyers = 0

print("ðŸ›’ Customer Purchase Simulation\n")

# Each visitor decides whether to buy
for i in range(visitors):
    if random.random() < prob:
        buyers += 1

print(f"Total Visitors: {visitors}")
print(f"Expected Buyers (Binomial Estimate): {buyers}")
print(f"Conversion Rate: {buyers / visitors * 100:.1f}%")

## ðŸ“¦ Where's Binomial Distribution?

Each visitor is:

* A trial
* Has 2 outcomes: Buy (1) or Not Buy (0)
* Fixed probability (30%)
* Independent trials


## ðŸ§  What You Learn

* Real use of binomial distribution in e-commerce
* Random simulation with probabilities
* How businesses estimate conversions
