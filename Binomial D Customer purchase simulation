## âœ… Real-Life Program Using Binomial Distribution

ðŸŽ¯ Program Idea: "Customer Purchase Simulation"

You run an online store. Out of 100 people who visit your website, each person has a 30% chance of buying something.

Letâ€™s simulate this using the binomial distribution to estimate how many people will actually buy.

---

## ðŸ’» Python Code (Using binomial distribution logic)

```python
import random

# Parameters
visitors = 100
purchase_probability = 0.3  # 30% chance of purchase
buyers = 0

print("ðŸ›’ Customer Purchase Simulation\n")

# Each visitor decides whether to buy
for i in range(visitors):
    if random.random() < purchase_probability:
        buyers += 1

# Output
print(f"Total Visitors: {visitors}")
print(f"Expected Buyers (Binomial Estimate): {buyers}")
print(f"Conversion Rate: {buyers / visitors * 100:.1f}%")
```

## ðŸ“¦ Where's Binomial Distribution?

Each visitor is:

* A trial
* Has 2 outcomes: Buy (1) or Not Buy (0)
* Fixed probability (30%)
* Independent trials

Thatâ€™s exactly the definition of a binomial distribution! You're simulating 100 binomial trials with p = 0.3.
