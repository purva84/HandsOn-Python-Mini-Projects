Iâ€™ve created a collection of Python projects inspired by real-life scenarios to gain practical, hands-on experience. Each project is designed to solve everyday problems like managing expenses, booking bus tickets, simulating customer purchases using probability, and even organizing study time or school bags.

These projects helped me strengthen my programming fundamentals while understanding how data and automation can improve small systems. I focused on writing clean, beginner-friendly code that connects classroom learning to real-world applications.

From logic-building and file handling to basic data analysis, these mini projects reflect my curiosity and self-learning approach to solving business and lifestyle problems using Python.
