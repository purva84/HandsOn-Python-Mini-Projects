📊 Program: "Student Study Hours Analysis"

You collected data on how many hours a student studies each day over a week. Now, you want to know:

* Total study time
* Average study time
* Variance and standard deviation (to see how consistent they are)

---

## 💻 Python Code

```python
import statistics

# Hours studied each day for a week
study_hours = [2, 3, 4, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5]  # sample data (can be user input too)

# Calculations
total = sum(study_hours)
average = statistics.mean(study_hours)
variance = statistics.variance(study_hours)
std_dev = statistics.stdev(study_hours)

# Output
print("📘 Study Hours Analysis (1 Week)\n")
print(f"Daily Study Hours: {study_hours}")
print(f"Total Study Hours: {total} hrs")
print(f"Average Daily Study Time: {average:.2f} hrs")
print(f"Variance: {variance:.2f}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev:.2f}")
```

## 🔍 Real-World Use Case

* A low standard deviation = consistent study habits
* A high standard deviation = irregular study times
* Schools, coaching centers, or productivity apps can use this kind of logic

## 🧠 What You Learn

* Use of statistics.mean(), variance(), and stdev()
* Real-world interpretation of variation in behavior
* Python list operations and summary statistics
